Aws_Lab_007

A Simple EC2 Auto Scaling + Load Balancing

Goal
This lab is a continuation of lab-006 with a Load Balancer added.

Overview

Step 1 - Create the Application Load Balancer
Follow step 5 of lab-005, but do not add any targets to the load balancer target group.

Step 2 - Edit the Auto Scaling Group
Edit the auto scaling group adding the load balancer target group created in the previous step.

Test and Validation

Copy the DNS name associated with the load balancer and, using a browser, try to access it. You should be 
able to see the response associated with the only EC2 instance that is running and automatically launched by 
the auto scaling service. Now connect to this instance through SSH and run the following commands to 
artificially increase CPU utilization.

stress -c 200

You can then begin monitoring the instance's CPU utilization increase and verify than when it reaches 75% or 
above a new EC2 instance will automatically be launched by the auto scaling service. When that happens, 
verify that the auto scaling service will automatically launch a second EC2 instance. Now using the DNS 
associated with the load balancer, verify whether you are able to see responses from both instances as you 
refresh the page. This test proves that the application load balancer is working properly by redirecting the 
request evenly to the two instances.
