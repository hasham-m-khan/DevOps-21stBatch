Aws_Lab_010

An RDS Instance with a Standby

Goal
This lab is similar to lab-009 with the addition of a standby RDS instance in another AZ to simulate a failover scenario.

Overview

Having an RDS instance in a multi-az configuration means that another instance will run on standby mode in
another AZ. Writings done on the primary instance are also done on the secondary, and this is done 
synchronously. In the case of a failure of the primary, the secondary (the one running on standby mode) 
takes over and become the primary database instance.

Follow the steps described in lab-009 with the following changes when creating the RDS instance:

Templates: Dev/Test (free-tier won't work this time)

DB instance identifier: lab010

DB instance size: select Burstable classes and pick the db.t2.small

Multi-az deployment: select multi-az deployment (of course)

Connectivity: set your custom VPC to be the one where your RDS instance will run; in the additional connectivity configuration - VPC security group, choose Create new and name it lab010sg; finally for the availability zone choose the one suffixed with 1a (or the first option that appears to you)

Additional configurations: set the initial database name to lab010 and disable automatic backups

Test and Validation

Open a browser and using the EC2 instance's public IP address, connect to the database via phpMyAdmin in 
the same way explained in lab-009. The screen below shows on which AZ the primary RDS instance is running.

To simulate a failure, select Action and then Reboot.

On the next screen, choose Reboot With Failover.

You should then notice that the secondary takes over and becomes the primary.
You can attest that by verifying that the database is now running on a different AZ.

Make sure you can still access the database via phpMyAdmin. The change should take only a few seconds.
