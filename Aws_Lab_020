Running an Amazon ECS Sample App

Goal
This lab illustrates how to launch a web server using Amazon ECS's Fargate service.

Overview
Fargate is a fully managed container service that automatically allocates computing resources to run 
containers with scaling capabilities. To best understand Amazon's Elastic Container Service let's break it into components:

Container: packaging of an application including code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and everything else needed to run an application (a container is created from an image);

Cluster: a logical group of tasks or services (this lab will create an ECS cluster containing a single task);

Task: specified in JSON format, a task defines what to do (the application itself), where to run it (minimum infrastructure requirements), and how to run it (logging, scaling configurations, security configurations, etc.);

Service: number of instances of tasks to run and launching parameters.

Note that a cluster can contain tasks that are running on distinct containers.

To start this lab go to ECS and click on Get started. This lab will create a Fargate cluster using the sample-app template.

Step 1 - Choose a Container's Image
Select the sample-app container image which has definitions to run a web server using a single task.

Step 2 - Provide Service Settings
For lab you can accept the default settings.

Step 3 - Configure your Cluster

Step 4 - Review
When the configuration is deployed, click on view service.

Test and Validation
Click on Tasks an then on the single task displayed. Copy the public IP and test it using a browser. You should be able to see the web server initial page.
